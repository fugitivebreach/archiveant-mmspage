                <h2>2. Authorization to Use Bot Credentials</h2>
                <p>To enable hosting, the Developer grants MMBS authorization to securely store and use:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discord Bot Token</li>
                    <li>API keys</li>
                    <li>Required environment variables and configuration secrets</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This authorization is strictly limited to purposes necessary to operate, maintain, and host the bot.</p>
                <p>MMBS agrees that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bot credentials will never be shared publicly</li>
                    <li>Access is restricted to authorized MMBS personnel only</li>
                    <li>Credentials will be stored using secure access controls</li>
                    <li>Credentials will not be used for development outside of hosting operations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>3. Developer Compliance Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>The Developer represents and warrants that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The bot complies with Discord's Terms of Service and Developer Policies</li>
                    <li>The bot does not contain malware, token grabbers, unauthorized automation, or harmful code</li>
                    <li>All code, assets, and functionality are legally owned or properly licensed</li>
                    <li>The Developer will immediately rotate the bot token if a security concern arises</li>
                </ul>
                <p>MMBS reserves the right to suspend or terminate hosting if the bot violates platform policies, laws, or this Agreement.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Service Availability</h2>
                <p>MMBS will use reasonable efforts to maintain service uptime but does not guarantee uninterrupted availability. Service interruptions may occur due to:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>MMBS is not liable for losses caused by downtime or service interruptions.</p>
                
                <h2>5. Security Practices</h2>
                <p>MMBS implements reasonable security measures including:</p>

                    <li>Network and firewall protections</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Developer acknowledges that no system can be guaranteed 100% secure.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>All intellectual property rights in the bot, including code, branding, and features, remain the sole property of the Developer. Hosting services do not transfer ownership rights to MMBS.</p>
                
                <h2>7. Suspension and Termination</h2>
                <p>Either party may terminate hosting services at any time.</p>
                <p>Upon termination:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MMBS will delete stored bot credentials within a reasonable timeframe</li>
                    <li>Hosting data may be removed after a short retention window</li>
                    <li>The Developer is responsible for revoking or regenerating tokens after service ends</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>MMBS shall not be liable for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data loss</li>
                    <li>Revenue loss</li>
                    <li>Discord enforcement actions</li>
                    <li>Third-party misuse of the bot</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Liability, if any, is limited to the amount paid for hosting services during the previous billing period.</p>
                
                <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>The Developer agrees to indemnify and hold MMBS harmless from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from:</p>

                    <li>User interactions with the bot</li>
                    <li>Violations of platform rules or laws</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>10. Modifications to Terms</h2>
                <p>MMBS may update these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of hosting services after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
                
                <p><strong>By submitting a bot for hosting, the Developer acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agreed to this Terms of Service Agreement.</strong></p>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>To provide hosting services, MMBS may collect and process the following categories of information.</p>

                </ul>
                
                <p>MMBS does not intentionally collect private Discord user messages unless the bot itself is designed to log such data. Responsibility for user data collected by the bot remains with the Developer.</p>
                
                <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
                <p>Information collected is used strictly for operational purposes, including:</p>

                <h2>3. Credential Security</h2>
                <p>Bot tokens and related credentials are treated as confidential. MMBS implements reasonable safeguards to protect them, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Secure storage environments</li>
                    <li>Restricted personnel access</li>
                    <li>Access control systems</li>
                    <li>Monitoring and logging of credential access</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Credentials are never shared publicly and are only used for hosting-related operations.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>MMBS retains credentials and operational logs only while hosting services remain active. After service termination:</p>

                    <li>Bot credentials are deleted within a reasonable timeframe</li>
                    <li>Logs may be temporarily retained for security or auditing purposes before deletion</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>5. Third-Party Infrastructure Providers</h2>
                <p>MMBS may use third-party hosting providers or infrastructure services to operate its systems. These providers may process limited technical data as necessary to maintain hosting operations. MMBS selects providers that follow industry-standard security practices.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Developer Rights and Requests</h2>
                <p>The Developer may request:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information about stored credentials</li>
                    <li>Deletion of hosted credentials</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Requests must be made through official MMBS communication channels.</p>
                
                <h2>7. Data Responsibility for Bot Users</h2>
                <p>If the hosted bot collects, stores, or processes end-user data, the Developer is solely responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing an end-user privacy policy</li>
                    <li>Complying with applicable data protection laws</li>
                    <li>Managing user data collected by the bot</li>
                </ul>
                <p>MMBS acts only as a hosting provider and does not control how the bot processes user information.</p>
                
                <h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
                <p>MMBS may update this Privacy Policy as services evolve. Continued use of hosting services after updates indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>By using Military Marketplace Bot Services hosting, the Developer acknowledges that they have read and agreed to this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
