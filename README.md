### Logging

The server logs all requests with:

npm test
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is busy, change it:

PORT=8080 npm start
```

### Module Not Found
Reinstall dependencies:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Deployment Issues on Railway
