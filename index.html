                <p class="highlight-text">By submitting a bot or service for hosting, you agree to the terms below.</p>
                
                <h2>1. Service Scope</h2>
                <p>MEBS provides managed hosting services for Discord bots and related backend systems. Services may include:</p>

                <p>MEBS acts solely as a technical hosting provider and does not claim ownership of your bot, source code, branding, or intellectual property.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Authorization to Use Bot Credentials</h2>
                <p>To enable hosting, you grant MEBS authorization to securely store and use:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discord Bot Tokens</li>
                    <li>API keys and webhooks</li>
                    <li>Environment variables and configuration secrets</li>
                    <li>Database connection strings</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This authorization is strictly limited to purposes necessary to deploy, operate, maintain, and secure your hosted services.</p>
                <p><strong>MEBS agrees that:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Credentials will never be shared publicly or with third parties</li>
                    <li>Access is restricted to authorized personnel only</li>
                    <li>Credentials are stored using industry-standard encryption</li>
                    <li>Credentials are not used for development or distribution outside hosting operations</li>
                    <li>Access logs are maintained for security auditing</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>You represent and agree that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your bot complies with Discord's Terms of Service and Developer Policies</li>
                    <li>Your software does not contain malware, token grabbers, self-bots, or harmful automation</li>
                    <li>You own or have proper rights to all code and assets</li>
                    <li>You will rotate credentials immediately if a security issue is suspected</li>
                    <li>You will not use services for illegal activities or spam</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for your bot's behavior and compliance with applicable laws</li>
                </ul>
                <p>MEBS reserves the right to suspend or terminate hosting if your service violates platform rules, laws, or this Agreement.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Service Availability</h2>
                <p>MEBS makes reasonable efforts to maintain uptime but does not guarantee uninterrupted service. Downtime may occur due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scheduled maintenance (with advance notice when possible)</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure or hardware failures</li>
                    <li>Security incidents or mitigation measures</li>
                    <li>Third-party provider outages (Discord, cloud providers)</li>
                    <li>DDoS attacks or network issues</li>
                    <li>Emergency updates or patches</li>
                </ul>
                <p>MEBS is not liable for losses caused by downtime or service interruptions. We will make reasonable efforts to communicate significant outages.</p>
                
                <h2>5. Security Practices</h2>
                <p>We implement reasonable security measures, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Restricted system and panel access with multi-factor authentication</li>
                    <li>Encrypted credential storage and transmission</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure and intrusion monitoring</li>
                    <li>Network firewalls and DDoS protection</li>
                    <li>Regular security audits and updates</li>
                    <li>Isolated hosting environments per client</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No system can be guaranteed completely secure, and you acknowledge this inherent risk in any online service.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>All intellectual property rights in your bot, including source code, data, and branding, remain your exclusive property. Hosting services do not transfer ownership to MEBS. You grant us only the limited license necessary to operate your hosted service.</p>
                
                <h2>7. Suspension and Termination</h2>
                <p>Either party may terminate hosting services at any time with reasonable notice.</p>
                <p><strong>Upon termination:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stored credentials will be securely deleted within 30 days</li>
                    <li>Hosting data may be removed after a 7-day retention period for recovery</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for revoking or regenerating old tokens</li>
                    <li>Final backups may be provided upon request (fees may apply)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>MEBS may immediately suspend services for violations of this Agreement or to comply with legal requirements.</p>
                
                <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>MEBS is not liable for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data loss or corruption</li>
                    <li>Revenue loss or business interruption</li>
                    <li>Account penalties from Discord or other platforms</li>
                    <li>Third-party misuse of your bot</li>
                    <li>Consequential, indirect, or punitive damages</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Total liability, if any, is limited to the amount paid for hosting services during the most recent 3-month billing period.</p>
                
                <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>You agree to indemnify and hold MEBS harmless from claims, damages, or expenses arising from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your bot's functionality or content</li>
                    <li>User interactions with your service</li>
                    <li>Violations of laws, platform policies, or third-party rights</li>
                    <li>Your breach of this Agreement</li>
                </ul>
