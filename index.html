                </ul>
                <p>MEBS acts solely as a technical hosting provider and does not claim ownership of your bot, source code, branding, or intellectual property.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Authorization to Use Bot Credentials</h2>
                <p>To enable hosting, you grant MEBS authorization to securely store and use:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discord Bot Tokens</li>
                    <li>API keys</li>
                    <li>Environment variables and configuration secrets</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This authorization is strictly limited to purposes necessary to deploy, operate, maintain, and secure your hosted services.</p>
                <p>MEBS agrees that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Credentials will never be shared publicly</li>
                    <li>Access is restricted to authorized personnel only</li>
                    <li>Credentials are stored using secure access controls</li>
                    <li>Credentials are not used for development or distribution outside hosting operations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>You represent and agree that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your bot complies with Discord's Terms of Service and Developer Policies</li>
                    <li>Your software does not contain malware, token grabbers, self-bots, or harmful automation</li>
                    <li>You own or have proper rights to all code and assets</li>
                    <li>You will rotate credentials immediately if a security issue is suspected</li>
                </ul>
                <p>MEBS reserves the right to suspend or terminate hosting if your service violates platform rules, laws, or this Agreement.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Service Availability</h2>
                <p>MEBS makes reasonable efforts to maintain uptime but does not guarantee uninterrupted service. Downtime may occur due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scheduled maintenance</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure or hardware failures</li>
                    <li>Security incidents</li>
                    <li>Third-party provider outages</li>
                </ul>
                <p>MEBS is not liable for losses caused by downtime or service interruptions.</p>
                
                <h2>5. Security Practices</h2>
                <p>We implement reasonable security measures, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Restricted system and panel access</li>
                    <li>Credential access controls</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure monitoring</li>
                    <li>Network and firewall protections</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No system can be guaranteed completely secure, and you acknowledge this risk.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>All intellectual property rights in your bot, including code, data, and branding, remain your property. Hosting services do not transfer ownership to MEBS.</p>
                
                <h2>7. Suspension and Termination</h2>
                <p>Either party may terminate hosting services at any time.</p>
                <p>Upon termination:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stored credentials will be deleted within a reasonable timeframe</li>
                    <li>Hosting data may be removed after a short retention period</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for revoking or regenerating old tokens</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>MEBS is not liable for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data loss</li>
                    <li>Revenue loss</li>
                    <li>Account penalties from Discord or other platforms</li>
                    <li>Third-party misuse of your bot</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Liability, if any, is limited to the amount paid for hosting services during the most recent billing period.</p>
                
                <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>You agree to indemnify and hold MEBS harmless from claims or damages arising from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your bot's functionality</li>
                    <li>User interactions with your service</li>
                    <li>Violations of laws or platform policies</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>

                <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>We retain credentials and operational logs only while your hosting service remains active. After termination:</p>
